# Hangman game


This is a CLI version of the Hangman game, as developed while working through chapter 13 of the book [Haskell Programming from first principles](https://haskellbook.com/)

## Setup

You need to install `stack`. On macs, `brew install stack` should suffice. After cloning the repository, you may build it by running `stack build` from its root. Finally, you may start the game by executing `stack hangman`.
